    Orignal Question:
    
    Sentence Smash

Write a function that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence and returns the sentence.
You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between each word. 
Be careful, there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or the end of the sentence!
